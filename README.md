# clinical-task-ai-assistance-experiment

R-based statistical analysis of experiment data collected for 2023 MIT Master's thesis.

The data analyzed here (ala_exp_data_all.csv) are the results from an experiment investigating the influence of an AI-based clinical decision support tool (CDSS) for the completion of various tasks. The experiment involved 9 participants doing multiple tasks ("runs") both with and without the AI assistance. The runs are organized as "pairs" in the data such that tasks within a pair are of similar difficulty, and each pair includes one task completed with AI assistance and one task completed without AI as a control.

The data is analyzed here to address two main research questions:
- Does the AI assistance tool (ALA) contribute to better/more accurate outcomes?
- Does the AI assistance tool (ALA) contribute to shorter (improved) task times?
